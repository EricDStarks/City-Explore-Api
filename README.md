## Overview
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications. I'm building this to physically learn and get familiar with the node.js application and the building functionality of it.

## Getting Started
Install node.js, create a project directory, initialize the project, create the application files, install dependecies, write your application code, run the application.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
